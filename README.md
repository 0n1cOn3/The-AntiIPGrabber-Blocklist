## 🚫The Anti-IP-Grabber Blocklist📋

This robust and dynamic list is a comprehensive 🔍 and continually updated 🔄 collection of domains 🌐. 
These domains have been identified because of their proven activities associated with IP grabbing.

Anti-IP-Grabber Blocklist involves illicitly capturing the domains of internet users without their consent. 
This practice can lead to a range of harmful actions, such as online tracking, data theft, or cyberattacks. It acts as a powerful shield 🛡️ to protect your networks 🖥️ and systems from these unwanted intrusions 👾. By blocking 🛑 access from these specific domains, it significantly reduces the risk of potentially harmful activities impacting your systems.


## What is this Blocklist for ?

This blocklist is designed to be compatible with a range of network tools, including AdGuard and Pi-hole.


## Adguard & Pi-Hole

With AdGuard 🛡️, a popular ad-blocking software, our blocklist enhances the tool's ability to prevent malicious or intrusive elements from loading on your device. It fits seamlessly into your AdGuard setup to add an extra layer of protection to your browsing experience.

Pi-hole 🕳️, an open-source software for network-wide ad blocking and Internet tracking prevention, can also benefit from our blocklist. By integrating the Anti-IP-Grabber Blocklist into your Pi-hole, you add a robust defense layer that enhances your control over your network's safety.

## The target of this project

My goal is to provide a safer, cleaner, and more private internet experience for users. So, take control of your digital environment today by incorporating the IP-Grabber Blocklist into your network protection tools. It's a proactive step towards robust online security 🔒.
